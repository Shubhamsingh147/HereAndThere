This is a Civil Engg Animation to demonstrate the variation of load.

<h3>
The App is easy to use and simple in design.
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enter the max-loads to adjust the thickness of the road.Type in both inputs to see changes.</li>
	<li>Enter the current load to see live variation of the effect on roads as well as number of cars on road.</li>
	<li>Current weight more than or equal to 100 would increase the number of cars to 2 and so on.</li>
	<li>Limit, till now , set on number of cars is 3.(As it would eat up more of your screen size to increse the thickness).</li>
	<li>Personally I don't like the background right now.If you have any suggestions or any feedback inform me at the <a href="http://facebook.com/shubhamsingh147"/> link</a>.This is NOT the final version.</li>
	
	
</ul>
